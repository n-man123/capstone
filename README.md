Preliminary Project Proposal


1.  High level description of the project: what question or problem are you addressing?

I’m working with a Palo Alto tech consulting startup, Convetit (www.convetit.com).  They are in the business of identifying SMEs (subject matter experts) and connecting them to C-suite executives of mid-to-large companies (P&G, Bayer, etc.).  The executives receive a “data dump” of relevant knowledge from these SMEs over a 4-day moderated engagement (which Convetit arranges and charges fees for).

Convetit is basically in the business of curating and amassing knowledge related to various technical  subject areas; and identifying SMEs related to those subject areas.  They have scraped “tags” (these can be thought of ’n-grams’ in NLP parlance) from tens of thousands of webpages (but primarily from Linkedin).  They have additionally identified SMEs affiliated with these tags.  I have been provided these two datasets and asked to “make sense of them” and “see what data science can reveal”.  It’s not a particularly specific request so far.  

2. How are you presenting your work? (web app, visualization, presentation/slides, etc.)

I’m exploring NLP techniques to apply to this data to “bucketize” the tags into topics; I’m also thinking about finding associations between tags and SMEs.  This is my initial idea.  I'll explore how to serve web pages from Domino to present my findings.
